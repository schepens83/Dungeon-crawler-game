to do:
-dragon tallons iets anders van maken. Ook bij de smithy laten maken tot dragon talons. Beide nodig om de griffons te bevechten. 1 van de 2 en je verliest.
-add extra items
-add drop item
-pretify the text. met \n met name van lange stukken.
-actions? een hash van maken met verklarende text wat de acties doen.

-optional: implementeer een weight systeem voor je sack met gewichten per item als extra attribute.
