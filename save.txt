      you no longer see a dust cloud behind you. Either they relented or did as you
      predicted. After a while you find yourself in a more adventageous landscape.

      of the pack down on you. You cross the last couple of meters in a dash. The
      rider turns around in alarm, but you jump on top of the horse and take the rider
      out before he can call his friends. With another quick move you silence the
      horse. Quickly you look through the riders bags. Nothing remarkable except a
      set of middle-long, blunt blades. \nRethinking what to do now, you turn around

      as far as you can make out though. Carefully you set out. \n\nWhen you hear

      like their situation much less and try to change their collision course. Using
      the momentum gained by your tail action, you swing your body towards the closest
      of the two trailing and manage to make a solid connection with one of its wings.

      don't know where the others are and in a quick movement you circle around. The
      three diversions had used the time to approach from the right, while the third
      initial attacker had joined them. They look more uncertain now and start circling
      around you. The wounded one on the ground screeches out to them and with more
      confidence in their flight, they move out to protect it. That must be the leader
      than. You feel a pang of regret you didn't take him out when you had the chance,
      but repress it. You made the sensible move as it would have left you open for
      attack. Slowly you start to circle around the leader and re-evaluate the situation.
      You realize this fight is over. Griphons without the leader of the pack have
      little appetite for danger. As you've shown them you can handle six they won't
      come back with four. Especially with their leader incapacitated and grounded.
      You are not the one that needs to finish this fight. Moving backwards and out

      have emptied as its population hides inside their houses. You know this village
      and would have left it alone if you didn't need something. Walking along the
      main road you approach the smithy. \nThough the smith is a big man, he is unwilling
      to come outside at first. You have to insist. Although the stick would have
      been enough, you feel sorry enough for the men to use the carrot as well. You
      promise him he will be compensated by the empire. He seems willing to work his
      trade."

      Cheerfully you climb the wide circling hallway up to your lair. The emperors ancestors had this especially made for your lineage. As you round the top you hear the cheers of joy and surprise as your young hatchlings see you. Calling out with joy they run and jump on top of you. Laughing, you let them and start playfully tossing them around. Later, there will be time to give report to the emperor of your destruction of the human and elven rebellion. For now you enjoy the simple play of your family.
